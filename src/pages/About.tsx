            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              ATL Construction is comprised of a motivated and experienced group of managers who felt that a consistent level of service and attention was missing from the development industry. ATL Construction was formed to fill a niche market offering clients an unmatched level of attention, care and overall project management.

              Every project is represented by one dedicated supervisor. Each supervisor brings specific skills and talents to the table, but all supervisors work collaboratively to take advantage of their combined strengths and experiences. Clients benefit greatly from this unique approach, and can feel confident knowing that their project is supported by a strong team.
